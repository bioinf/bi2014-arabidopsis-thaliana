Finding SNV (Short read alignment).

1. Attach short reads to the reference assembly to determine individual features of the given genome.
2. Multiples short reads FASTQ -> Scaffold FASTA -> Polymorfysm
3. Tools: Bowtie, BWA for alignment; samtools (earlier than version 1.0(!!!!) to remove repeats) or GATK for variant calling; vcftools, bctools, GATK.

4. Find some reads for Arabidopsis (for example, here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)

5. Consequently use tool in the proper order.
